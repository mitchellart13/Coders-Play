Let's create an awesome website for fun

Hey there for everyone to see! My name is Mitchell and i'm trying to create a website with one of my friends from college. Tho, we don't
know what we are going to create yet. I have some experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I'm hoping to maybe implement some cool
features with Node.JS or Angular.JS. I haven't made any web pages that are on the interwebs. I've only done some small projects for school
and for fun.

Let's start brainstorming! If you have any ideas on things we should create that would be wonderful. Hopefully this project doesn't burn out.
